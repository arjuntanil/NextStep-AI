# History & Dashboard Fixes - Complete Summary

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: History Not Saving
**Problem:** User history was empty (no CV analyses, career queries, or RAG queries saved).

**Root Cause:** Database records were only created when `current_user` was logged in. Anonymous users (without JWT tokens) had no records persisted.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Modified `POST /analyze_resume/` to **always** persist `ResumeAnalysis` records (owner_id NULL for anonymous users)
- ✅ Modified `POST /query-career-path/` to **always** persist `CareerQuery` records with response time and model used
- ✅ Modified `POST /career-advice-ai` to **always** persist `CareerQuery` records with full metadata
- ✅ Added graceful error handling (DB errors logged but don't break user requests)
- ✅ Added `resume_filename` and `total_skills_count` to `ResumeAnalysis` records

### Issue 2: Unwanted History Sections in User Dashboard
**Problem:** User history showed "AI Career Advisor Queries" and "Resume Analysis (with JD)" which weren't needed.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Removed "💬 Past AI Career Advisor Queries" section from user history tab
- ✅ Removed "🧑‍💼 Past Resume Analysis (with JD)" section from user history tab
- ✅ Kept only "📄 Past CV Analyses" in user history tab

### Issue 3: Unwanted Metrics in Admin Dashboard
**Problem:** Admin dashboard showed AI Career Advisor and Resume Analyzer metrics, charts, and insights that weren't needed.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Removed AI Career Advisor usage line from engagement chart
- ✅ Removed Resume Analyzer usage line from engagement chart
- ✅ Removed "💬 AI Career Advisor" metric card
- ✅ Removed "🧑‍💼 Resume Analyzer" metric card
- ✅ Simplified analytics to show **only CV Analyzer** metrics
- ✅ Updated strategic recommendations to focus on CV Analyzer only
- ✅ Removed "Feature Diversity Score" and multi-feature comparisons
- ✅ Changed "Daily Engagement Average" to show CV Analyzer uses only

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `backend_api.py` (3 changes)

#### Change 1: `/analyze_resume/` endpoint (Lines ~975-990)
```python
# BEFORE: Only saved if current_user exists
if current_user:
    new_analysis = ResumeAnalysis(owner_id=current_user.id, ...)

```

#### Change 2: `/query-career-path/` endpoint (Lines ~990-1050)
```python
# BEFORE: Only saved if current_user exists
if current_user:
    new_query = CareerQuery(owner_id=current_user.id, ...)
    db.add(new_query); db.commit()

# AFTER: Always saves with timing metadata
import time
t0 = time.perf_counter()
# ... model execution ...
t1 = time.perf_counter()
response_time_seconds = int(t1 - t0)

try:
    new_query = CareerQuery(
        owner_id=current_user.id if current_user else None,
        user_query_text=query.text,
        matched_job_group=matched_job_group,

async def get_career_advice_ai(
    request: CareerAdviceRequest,
    db: SessionLocal = Depends(get_db),  # NEW
    current_user: Optional[User] = Depends(get_current_user_optional)  # NEW

        db.commit()
    except Exception as _e:
        print(f"[WARN] Could not persist career-advice-ai query: {_e}")
```

### 2. `app.py` (5 changes)

#### Change 1: User History Tab - Removed AI Career Advisor section (Lines ~1315-1333)
```python
# BEFORE: Showed 3 sections
st.subheader("📄 Past Resume Analyses")
# ... analyses code ...
st.subheader("💬 Past AI Career Advisor Queries")
# ... queries code ...
st.subheader("🧑‍💼 Past Resume Analysis (with JD)")
# ... rag queries code ...

# AFTER: Shows only 1 section
st.subheader("📄 Past CV Analyses")
# ... analyses code ...
# (AI Career Advisor and RAG sections removed)
```

#### Change 2: Admin Dashboard - Removed AI Career Advisor and Resume Analyzer data generation (Lines ~187-250)
```python
# BEFORE: Generated 3 feature usage timelines
cv_analyzer_usage = ...
career_advisor_usage = ...  # REMOVED
resume_analyzer_usage = ...  # REMOVED

# AFTER: Generates only CV Analyzer timeline
cv_analyzer_usage = ...
# (career_advisor_usage and resume_analyzer_usage removed)
```

#### Change 3: Admin Dashboard - Removed extra chart traces (Lines ~211-250)
```python
# BEFORE: Added 3 traces to chart
fig_engagement.add_trace(cv_analyzer_trace)
fig_engagement.add_trace(career_advisor_trace)  # REMOVED
fig_engagement.add_trace(resume_analyzer_trace)  # REMOVED

# AFTER: Adds only CV Analyzer trace
fig_engagement.add_trace(cv_analyzer_trace)
```

#### Change 4: Admin Dashboard - Removed metric cards (Lines ~250-280)
```python
# BEFORE: Showed 2 metric cards
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.metric("💬 AI Career Advisor", ...)  # REMOVED
with col2:
    st.metric("🧑‍💼 Resume Analyzer", ...)  # REMOVED

# AFTER: Shows only 1 metric card
st.metric("📄 CV Analyzer", f"{cv_total} total uses", delta=f"+{cv_growth_pct:.0f}% growth")
st.caption(f"📊 Avg: {cv_avg} uses/day | 🔥 Peak: {cv_peak_value} on {cv_peak_day}")
```

#### Change 5: Admin Dashboard - Simplified insights (Lines ~280-330)
```python
# BEFORE: Complex multi-feature analytics
most_popular = max([('AI Career Advisor', ...), ('Resume Analyzer', ...)], ...)
fastest_growing = max([('AI Career Advisor', ...), ('Resume Analyzer', ...)], ...)
diversity_score = (min_usage / max_usage) * 100
# ... 2-column layout with health status ...

# AFTER: Single-feature analytics
st.success(f"""
**📊 Growth Analysis**
- **CV Analyzer:** {cv_total:,} total uses
- **Growth Rate:** +{cv_growth_pct:.1f}%
- **Week-over-Week Growth:** +{wow_growth:.1f}%
- **Daily Engagement Average:** {engagement_per_day:.0f} uses
""")

# Simplified recommendations (no diversity, no multi-feature comparisons)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Anonymous History Claiming:**
   - Add session-based tracking (temporary UUID in cookies)
   - When user logs in, allow claiming anonymous entries made in same session
   - Requires frontend session management + backend linking endpoint

2. **Admin Analytics Filtering:**
   - Add date range picker for admin dashboard
   - Filter analytics by custom date ranges
   - Export analytics as CSV/PDF

3. **Real-time Database Metrics:**
   - Replace simulated data with actual database queries
   - Use `COUNT(*)` grouped by `DATE(created_at)` for real usage trends
   - Cache results for performance

4. **Audit Logging:**
   - Replace `print()` statements with proper logging (`logging.info`, `logging.error`)
   - Add request ID tracking for debugging
   - Configure log rotation and retention
