# Accurate Career Advisor LLM - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The previous fine-tuned model was generating **incoherent and irrelevant responses**:
- Random text about "Reliance India Network", "Canadian", "CIPS® QI"
- No structured skills or interview questions
- Not matching the user's query at all

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Cleaned Up Old Scripts**
Removed all previous failed fine-tuning attempts:
- `production_llm_finetuning.py`
- `test_production_llm.py`
- `simple_finetuning.py`
- `simple_pytorch_finetuning.py`
- `pythia_finetuning_complete.py`
- `quick_fix_training.py`
- `run_finetuning.py`
- `improved_finetuning.py`

### 2. **Created New Accurate Training Script**
**File: `accurate_career_advisor_training.py`**

#### Key Improvements:

**A. Better Data Formatting**
```python
# Training format that helps model learn structure
formatted = f"""<|startoftext|>### Question: {prompt}

### Answer: {completion}<|endoftext|>"""
```

**B. Optimized Parameters**
- **Model**: GPT-2 (124M parameters) - better than DistilGPT-2
- **Epochs**: 5 (instead of 3) - more learning iterations
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-5 (optimized for convergence)
- **Batch Size**: Adaptive based on CPU/GPU
- **Max Length**: 512 tokens (for detailed responses)
- **Temperature**: 0.8 (during generation)
- **Repetition Penalty**: 1.2 (prevents repetitive text)

**C. CPU/GPU Auto-Detection**
- Works efficiently on both CPU and RTX 2050
- Automatically adjusts batch size and FP16 settings
- No GPU required but will use it if available

### 3. **Updated Backend Integration**
**File: `backend_api.py`**

Changes made:
- Updated model path to `./career-advisor-accurate/final_model`
- Uses GPT2 tokenizer and model (not DistilGPT2)
- Improved generation parameters for accuracy
- Better prompt formatting matching training data

### 4. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite**
**File: `test_accurate_model.py`**

Tests verify:
- ✅ Relevant skills for each job role
- ✅ Interview questions included
- ✅ Structured formatting (bullets, sections)
- ✅ Coherent responses (not random text)
- ✅ NO irrelevant content (no weird phrases)

## 📊 Training Data Quality

**498 high-quality examples** from:
- `career_advice_dataset.jsonl` (243 entries)
- `career_advice_ultra_clear_dataset.jsonl` (255 entries)

Each example includes:
- Clear question/prompt
- Structured completion with:
  - ### Key Skills section
  - ### Top Certifications
  - ### Common Interview Questions
  - Proper formatting with bullets and sections

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Wait for Training to Complete
```powershell
# Training is currently running in background
# Expected time: 15-30 minutes on CPU
# You'll see: "Training completed!" message when done
```

### Step 2: Test the Model
```powershell
python test_accurate_model.py
```

Expected output:
- ✅ Model generates DevOps skills (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins)
- ✅ Model generates Software Development skills (Java, Python, Git)
- ✅ Model generates Networking skills (Cisco, TCP/IP, routing)
- ✅ Interview questions for each role
- ✅ Structured, coherent responses

### Step 3: Start the Backend API
```powershell
python -m uvicorn backend_api:app --port 8000
```

### Step 4: Test the API
```powershell
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/career-advice-ai" `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -d '{"question": "I love DevOps"}'
```

## 🎯 What Makes This Better

### Previous Model Issues:
❌ Generated: "Reliance India Network (RIT) network..."
❌ Generated: "Canadian...Ask 'canad..."
❌ Generated: "CIPS® QI: Tell us about..."
❌ No structure or relevant content

### New Model Improvements:
✅ **Better Base Model**: GPT-2 (124M) instead of DistilGPT-2 (82M)
✅ **More Training**: 5 epochs instead of 3
✅ **Better Formatting**: Clear delimiters for Q&A structure
✅ **Longer Context**: 512 tokens vs 400
✅ **Lower Learning Rate**: 5e-5 for stable convergence
✅ **Repetition Penalty**: Prevents weird repetitive text
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Checks for coherence and relevance

## 📈 Expected Results

After training completes, you should get responses like:

**Input**: "I love DevOps"

**Expected Output**:
```
DevOps Engineers are highly sought after in India's tech industry.

### Key Skills:
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible
* **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
* **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, GCP
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
* **Scripting:** Bash, Python, PowerShell

### Common Interview Questions:
* 'Explain your approach to implementing CI/CD pipelines.'
* 'How do you handle infrastructure scaling?'
* 'Describe a challenging deployment issue you resolved.'
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If GPU Not Detected (RTX 2050)
Your PyTorch installation doesn't have CUDA support. The script now works efficiently on CPU, but if you want GPU acceleration:

```powershell
# Install PyTorch with CUDA support
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### If Training Fails
- Check `career_advice_dataset.jsonl` and `career_advice_ultra_clear_dataset.jsonl` exist
- Ensure sufficient disk space (model is ~500MB)
- Check memory: GPT-2 needs ~2GB RAM for training

### If Model Still Generates Bad Responses
1. Delete `./career-advisor-accurate/` directory
2. Re-run `python accurate_career_advisor_training.py`
3. If still bad, increase epochs to 8-10 in the script
