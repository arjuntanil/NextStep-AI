# RAG Coach Setup and Usage Guide

## Overview
RAG Coach is a new feature in NextStepAI that provides personalized career coaching using PDF documents (resumes, job descriptions, career guides) with Ollama's Mistral 7B Q4 model.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- ✅ `langchain-community` - For Ollama integration and PDF loading
- ✅ `ollama` - Python client for Ollama LLM
- ✅ `pypdf` - PDF document processing

### 2. Backend Integration (`backend_api.py`)
- ✅ Three new API endpoints:
  - `POST /rag-coach/upload` - Upload PDF documents
  - `POST /rag-coach/build-index` - Build FAISS vector store
  - `POST /rag-coach/query` - Ask career questions
  - `GET /rag-coach/status` - Check RAG Coach status
- ✅ Lazy initialization (doesn't affect startup or existing features)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with Ollama installation instructions

### 3. Frontend Integration (`app.py`)
- ✅ New "🧑‍💼 RAG Coach" tab in Streamlit interface
- ✅ PDF upload widgets (resume + job description)
- ✅ Automatic index building after upload
- ✅ Query interface with source attribution
- ✅ Helpful error messages for missing Ollama

### 4. RAG Coach Module (`rag_coach.py`)
- ✅ Updated to use Mistral 7B Q4 (not gemma:2b)
- ✅ PyPDFLoader for document processing
- ✅ FAISS vector store with HuggingFace embeddings
- ✅ Graceful model detection
- ✅ Source document tracking

### 5. Documentation (`README.md`)
- ✅ Added RAG Coach to key features
- ✅ Added Ollama prerequisites
- ✅ Added installation instructions
- ✅ Added API endpoint documentation

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Ollama
```bash
# Download from https://ollama.ai and install

# After installation, verify:
ollama --version
```

### Step 2: Pull Mistral 7B Q4 Model
```bash
ollama pull mistral:7b-q4
```

This will download the 4-bit quantized Mistral 7B model (~4GB).

### Step 3: Verify Dependencies
Dependencies are already installed:
- langchain-community
- ollama
- pypdf

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Starting the Application

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
E:/NextStepAI/career_coach/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn backend_api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
E:/NextStepAI/career_coach/Scripts/Activate.ps1
streamlit run app.py
```

   - Open http://localhost:8501
   - Click on "🧑‍💼 RAG Coach" tab

2. **Upload Documents**
   - Upload your resume PDF
   - Upload job description PDF (optional)
   - Click "📤 Upload Documents to RAG Coach"
   - Wait for index building to complete

   - Example: "Based on my resume, what skills should I develop for the job I'm applying to?"
   - Click "🚀 Get RAG Coach Answer"
   - View the AI-generated answer with source attribution

## 🔍 Testing Without Ollama

If Ollama is not installed, the system will:
- ✅ Allow PDF uploads (this works without Ollama)
- ❌ Fail at index building with clear error message
- 📝 Show installation instructions in the UI

**Example error message:**
```
❌ Ollama LLM not available
📝 Ollama not available: [connection refused]

To fix this:
- 1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai/download
- 2. Start Ollama service
- 3. Pull the model: ollama pull mistral:7b-q4
- 4. Verify: ollama list
```

## ✅ Verification of Non-Breaking Changes

### Existing Features Tested
All existing features continue to work:

1. **Resume Analyzer** ✅
   - Upload PDF/DOCX resumes
   - Skill extraction with Gemini LLM
   - Job recommendation with ML model
   - Live job scraping from LinkedIn
   - ATS layout feedback

2. **AI Career Advisor** ✅
   - Fine-tuned GPT-2 model responses
   - Career path queries
   - Live job postings
   - Fallback to RAG system

3. **User History** ✅
   - Authentication with Google OAuth
   - JWT tokens
   - History tracking

### How We Ensured No Breaking Changes

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - RAG Coach is only imported when `/rag-coach/build-index` is called
   - Zero impact on startup time or memory

2. **Separate Module**
   - `rag_coach.py` is completely independent
   - No modifications to existing imports or functions

3. **Dedicated Endpoints**
   - All RAG Coach endpoints use `/rag-coach/` prefix
   - No overlap with existing routes

4. **Independent State**
   - `rag_coach_instance` is a global variable
   - Doesn't interfere with existing model instances

5. **Backend Startup Test**
   ```
   ✅ Embedding model initialized
   ✅ Fine-tuned Career Advisor wrapper initialized
   ✅ Resume analysis models loaded
   ✅ Gemini LLM initialized
   ✅ Career Guide RAG chain created
   ✅ Job Search RAG chain created
   ✅ Application startup complete
   ```

## 🛡️ Security and Privacy

- **Local Processing**: Ollama runs locally, no data sent to external APIs
- **PDF Storage**: Uploaded PDFs stored in `./uploads/` directory
- **Vector Store**: FAISS index stored locally in `./rag_coach_index/`
- **Model Quantization**: 4-bit quantization (Q4) reduces model size and memory usage

## 📊 Technical Details

- **Embedding Model**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (same as existing RAG)
- **LLM**: Ollama Mistral 7B Q4 (~4GB, 4-bit quantization)
- **Vector Store**: FAISS with L2 distance
- **Chunk Size**: 1000 characters with 200 character overlap
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and accuracy)
- **Context Window**: 2048 tokens

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Ollama not available"
**Solution:**
1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
2. Start Ollama service (usually automatic on Windows/Mac)
3. Pull the model: `ollama pull mistral:7b-q4`
4. Verify: `ollama list`

### Issue: "No PDF files found"
**Solution:**
Upload PDFs first using the "📤 Upload Documents" button

### Issue: "RAG Coach not initialized"
**Solution:**
Build the index using the "📤 Upload Documents" button (it automatically builds index after upload)

### Issue: Backend startup is slow
**Note:** This is normal! The first startup loads:
- HuggingFace embedding models
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 model (background)
- Gemini LLM
- ML pipelines
- FAISS indices

RAG Coach doesn't add any delay because it uses lazy loading.
