# 🚀 COMPLETE PROJECT STARTUP GUIDE
## New LLM_FineTuned Model Integrated & Optimized

---

## ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETE

**Primary Model**: `./LLM_FineTuned/` (68% quality, 80% certs, optimized for speed)
**Fallback Model**: `./career-advisor-perfect-final/` (safety backup)

**Optimizations Applied**:
- ⚡ Max tokens: 450 → 300 (33% faster generation)
- 🎯 Temperature: 0.8 → 0.75 (balanced speed + quality)
- 📏 Response length: 150-300 words (medium-length responses)
- 🚀 Target inference: < 2 seconds per response
- 💾 KV caching enabled for faster repeated queries

---

## 🏃 QUICK START (3 STEPS)

### STEP 1: Verify Model (Optional but Recommended)
```powershell
cd E:\NextStepAI
.\career_coach\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python TEST_NEW_MODEL.py
```
**Expected Output**: "Model test PASSED! Ready to start backend."

---

### STEP 2: Start Backend API
**Open PowerShell Terminal 1:**
```powershell
cd E:\NextStepAI
.\career_coach\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn backend_api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Wait for these messages:**
```
INFO:     Started server process [XXXX]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
Creating database and tables...
Loading AI models and artifacts...
[OK] Embedding model initialized
[INIT] Initializing Fine-tuned Career Advisor wrapper...
Loading model from ./LLM_FineTuned...  ← ✅ SHOULD SEE THIS
[OK] Fine-tuned Career Advisor loaded
[OK] Resume analysis models loaded
[OK] Career Guide RAG chain created
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**✅ Backend is ready when you see**: `Application startup complete`

---

### STEP 3: Start Frontend
**Open PowerShell Terminal 2 (after backend is ready):**
```powershell
cd E:\NextStepAI
.\career_coach\Scripts\Activate.ps1
streamlit run app.py
```

**Wait for:**
```
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.x.x:8501
```

**✅ Open browser**: http://localhost:8501

## 🧪 TEST THE NEW MODEL

### Quick Test
1. Open http://localhost:8501
2. Go to **"AI Career Advisor"** tab
3. Enter question: `"Tell me about Data Scientist career path and required skills"`
4. Click **"Get Career Advice"**
5. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Response appears in < 2 seconds
   - ✅ Response is 150-300 words (medium length)
   - ✅ Response is coherent and structured
   - ✅ Response includes certifications/skills/advice

### Expected Performance
- **Speed**: 1.5-2.5 seconds per response
- **Length**: 150-300 words (medium-length, as requested)
- **Quality**: 68% overall, 80% for certifications
- **Format**: Structured advice with bullet points

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Model Priority Order (in backend_api.py)
1. **LLM_FineTuned** ← PRIMARY (your new Colab model)
2. career-advisor-perfect-final ← FALLBACK 1
3. career_advisor_final ← FALLBACK 2
4. career-advisor-final ← FALLBACK 3

### Ollama Status
- **Current Status**: Already running from `RESTART_OLLAMA_CPU_MODE.bat`
- **Models Installed**: tinyllama, mistral:7b-instruct
- **Priority**: tinyllama (faster, less RAM)
- **No Action Needed**: Keep Ollama running in background

### Generation Settings (Optimized)
```python
min_new_tokens=150        # Ensures medium-length responses
max_new_tokens=300        # Faster than old 450 setting
temperature=0.75          # Balanced creativity/speed
top_p=0.92                # Focused sampling
top_k=40                  # Reduced for speed
repetition_penalty=1.15   # Lower = faster
use_cache=True            # KV cache for speed boost
```

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Port 8000 Already in Use
```powershell
# Find and kill process on port 8000
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /F /PID <PID_NUMBER>
```
**Or use automated script**: `.\FIX_AND_START.bat`

### Issue: Backend Shows Wrong Model
**Look for this in backend logs:**
```
Loading model from ./LLM_FineTuned...  ← Should see this
```
**If you see different path**:
1. Check folder exists: `ls LLM_FineTuned`
2. Verify files: Should have `model.safetensors` (328 MB)
3. Restart backend

### Issue: Model Generates Slowly (> 3 seconds)
**Possible causes**:
1. CPU mode (no GPU) - Normal, expect 2-3 seconds
2. First query (model loading) - Second query will be faster
3. Very long question - Keep questions under 100 words

**To improve**:
- Use shorter, focused questions
- Wait for KV cache to warm up (first 2-3 queries slower)
- Ensure no other heavy processes running

### Issue: Responses Too Short/Long
**Current settings target 150-300 words**
- Too short? Model trained on 200-word avg, should be fine
- Too long? Model will auto-stop at ~300 words or EOS token

## 📊 MODEL COMPARISON

| Model | Location | Quality | Speed | Status |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| **LLM_FineTuned** | `./LLM_FineTuned/` | 68% overall, 80% certs | ~2s | **ACTIVE** ✅ |
| career-advisor-perfect-final | `./career-advisor-perfect-final/` | Unknown | Unknown | FALLBACK 🔄 |

## 🎯 SUCCESS CHECKLIST

- ✅ Model files verified (TEST_NEW_MODEL.py passed)
- ✅ Backend shows "Loading model from ./LLM_FineTuned"
- ✅ Frontend opens at http://localhost:8501
- ✅ AI Career Advisor tab accessible
- ✅ Test query generates response in < 2 seconds
- ✅ Response is 150-300 words (medium length)
- ✅ Response is coherent and structured

## 📞 QUICK REFERENCE

### Start Everything
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd E:\NextStepAI ; .\career_coach\Scripts\Activate.ps1 ; python -m uvicorn backend_api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2: Frontend (wait for backend first)
cd E:\NextStepAI ; .\career_coach\Scripts\Activate.ps1 ; streamlit run app.py
```

### Stop Everything
- Press `CTRL+C` in both terminal windows
- Ollama keeps running in background (leave it)

### Restart After Code Changes
- Backend auto-reloads (uvicorn --reload flag)
- Frontend needs manual restart (CTRL+C then re-run)
