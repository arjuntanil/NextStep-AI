# Fix Ollama Memory Error - Complete Solution

## Problem
**Error**: `model requires more system memory (1.6 GiB) than is available (1.4 GiB)`

## Root Cause
Mistral 7B requires at least 1.6 GB of free RAM, but your system only has 1.4 GB available.

## Solutions (Choose ONE)

### ✅ SOLUTION 1: Free Up System Memory (FASTEST)

**Close unnecessary programs to free RAM:**

1. **Close these programs** (if running):
   - Chrome/Edge browsers
   - Large applications
   - Background programs

2. **Restart Ollama** after freeing memory:
   ```powershell
   Stop-Process -Name "ollama" -Force
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
   Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Users\Arjun T Anil\AppData\Local\Programs\Ollama\ollama.exe" -ArgumentList "serve"
   ```

3. **Test again**:
   ```powershell
   python test_rag_cpu_mode.py
   ```

### ✅ SOLUTION 2: Use Smaller Mistral Model (RECOMMENDED)

**Download and use the quantized Q2 model** (uses only 800 MB RAM):

```powershell
# Pull smaller model (2-3 minutes download)
ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-q2_K

# Verify it downloaded
ollama list
```

Then update `rag_coach.py` to use the smaller model (I'll do this for you).

### ✅ SOLUTION 3: Use TinyLlama (SMALLEST - 637 MB)

**If Mistral still doesn't fit, use TinyLlama**:

```powershell
# Pull TinyLlama (fastest download)
ollama pull tinyllama

# Verify
ollama list
```

| Solution | RAM Needed | Speed | Quality |
|----------|-----------|-------|---------|
| Close Programs | 1.6 GB | Fast | Best |
| Mistral Q2 | 800 MB | Medium | Good |
| TinyLlama | 637 MB | Fastest | Acceptable |
